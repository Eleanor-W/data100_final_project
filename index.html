            <h2>Our Findings</h2>
            <p>
                Our research found the the nubmer of medals won by a country at the Olympics cannot be easily predicted by the 
                country's population, GDP, or geographic location. All of the factors we looked at presented a moderate to 
                no relationship with number of medals won. However, there are some interesting trends. For the 2014 Winter
                Olympics, countries that were more northern and had higher GDP tended to win more medals. At the 2016 Summer Olympics,
                countries that were politically powerful and had higher GDP tended to win more medals. Population did not appear to 
                had a consistent trend with the number of medals won by a country.
