                <h2>An Overview of GDP per Capita</h2>
                    <h3>What is GDP per Capita?</h3>    
                        <p>Gross Domestic Product per Capita, referred to simply GDP per Capita, is a measure of economic output. GDP per capita provides a rough 
                        estimate of total amount of goods and services per person in a given country. The World Bank calculates GDP per capita by dividing Real GDP 
                        by mid-year population size. Real GDP is the total of all goods and services produced by the country, then adjusted for inflation.</p>
                    <h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
                        <p>Aside from obvious economic usages, GDP per Capita is often used to evaluate the standard of living in a country. In the past, the United
                        Nations considered GDP per capita when determing Human Development Index(HDI) values for the countries of the world. Since 2010, however, 
                        the UN has used different economic measures, but GDP per capita still remains an accurate and prevalent measure of development. A high GDP
                        per capita typically indicates a high level of standard of living in a country, with many of the countries with the highest GDP per capitas
                        also having some of the highest rankings on the HDI.</p>

                    <p> Looking at the graph, we see that countries with higher GDP per capita typically performed better in the games. The top three countries when 
                    it comes to medals are Norway with 26 medals, the United States with 28 medals, and Russia with 29 medals. The US and Norway follow the general 
                    pattern we see with GDP per capita and number of medals. In 2014, Norway's GDP per capita was $97,666, placing as the country with the 5th highest 
                    GDP per capita in the entire world at the time. On a similar note, the USA also placed in the top 20 for GDP per capita at 17th with a GDP per 
                    capita of $55,123. The only major exception we see in these games is Russia, the country with the most medals, yet the 5th lowest GDP per capita 
                    out of all medalling countries, and ranked 76th out of all the countries in the world, with a GDP per capita of $14,095. It should be noted, 
                    however, that this graph only includes countries that won at least one medal, so there could be some other outliers (wealthy countries winning 
                    no medals), but for the most part we see a possible positive correlation between GDP per capita and Number of Medals.</p>

                        <p>In 2016, we see a similar trend to 2014, with countries with higher GDP per capita typically performing better in the games, but the
                        relationship appears to have far less strength. There was a greater number of medalling countries, with just over 80 countries claiming at least 
                        1 medal, which definitely contributes some variation to the data. Some specific countries of interest in the 2016 Olympic Games include 
                        Switzerland, the United States, and China. Switzerland had the highest GDP per capita out of all the medalling countires, and 5th highest in the 
                        world at the time, at $82,153. The Swiss won 7 medals which is around the middle of the pack when it comes to medal count. The US by far 
                        performed the best in the games, winning a staggering 121 medals, and they ranked 5th with regards to GDP per capita among medalling countries 
                        with a GDP per capita of $57,866. This GDP per capita also made them the country with the 14th highest GDP in the world in 2016. Much like Russia 
                        in the 2014 games, China stands out for their 2nd place medal count, winning an impressive 70 medals, but rather low GDP per capita. China ranked 
                        among the bottom half of medalling with respect to GDP per capita and was ranked 93rd out of all the countries in the world at the time, with a 
                        GDP per capita of $8,094.</p>
