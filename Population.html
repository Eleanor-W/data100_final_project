                <h2>2014 Olympics</h2>
                <p>At the 2014 Winter Olympics, there wasn't a strong correlation between how many medals a country won
                    and the country's population size. There were a few contries that stood out. Russia won the most medals
                    at 29. Russia doesn't have the largest population; there are only about 150 million people in Russia. 
                    China had 1.4 billion people in 2014, yet only won nine medals. India is right behind China in terms 
                    of population, with 1.3 billion people, yet won a much fewer amount of medals with 0 medals won.

                <h2>2016 Olympics</h2>
                <p>
                    At the 2016 Summer Olympics, the number of medals a county won wasnâ€™t strong influenced by the 
                    country's population. There are a few countries that stand out when comparing nubmer of medals won
                    and country population. China and India have similar populations, at 1.4 and 1.3 billion people respectively, 
                    yet won vastly different amounts of medals, with India winning 2 medals and China winning 70. 
                    The United States of America, which has a population around 350 million, won 121 medals. This suggests 
                    the population of a country may not be a good indicator of how many medals a country won at the 2016 Olympics.
