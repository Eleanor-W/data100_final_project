        <main>
            <p>First we decided to visualize our Olympic data on a map in order to see geographic trends and compare them between the 2014 and 2016 Olympic games.
            </p>
            <h2>2014 Olympics</h2>
            <div>
                <iframe title="Countries that Performed Better in the 2014 Winter Olympics were Located Farther North " 
                aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-yZFlJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yZFlJ/7/" 
                scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" 
                height="481" data-external="1"></iframe>
                <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",
                (function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");
                for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source)
                {var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
            </div>
            <p>The 2014 map shows an interesting trend where most of the countries that did well in the olympics seem to be clustered towards the northern part of the map. In particular, every country that won more than 5 medals had borders extending into the upper half of the Northern Hemisphere (above latitude 45N), with the sole exception of South Korea, which was only slightly below. One reason may be that countries which are located farther north tend to get more winter weather, and so winter sports may be more popular or easy to practice in the countries, leading to them doing better in the winter Olympics. However, there are likely other factors influencing this trend as well.
            </p>
            <h2>2016 Olympics</h2>
            <div>
                <iframe title="Politically Powerful Countries Won the Most Olympic Medals in 2016 " 
                aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-5wN6r" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5wN6r/3/" 
                scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" 
                height="506" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function()
                {"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                {var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]
                +"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
            </div>
            <p>In the 2016 map, more countries are competing and the data is more spread out. However, 2016 shows an interesting trend of its own. The top five countries ranked by number of medals won are the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Russia, and France, which is tied with Germany for fifth place. All of these countries hold substantial political power, and all except Germany are permanent members of the UN security council, enhancing their political strength. 
            </p>
            <p>There could be a number of explanations for this trend of politically powerful countries winning more medals. Perhaps some combination of the size and wealth of these countries means they have more athletes or are able to invest in training them more. It is also possible that these countries choose to invest more in their olympic athletes as a way of promoting their national strength or identity, or as a peaceful way of competing with each other due to geopolitical rivalries. While we cannot know for sure what causes these countries to win more medals, it would be an interesting topic for further research.
